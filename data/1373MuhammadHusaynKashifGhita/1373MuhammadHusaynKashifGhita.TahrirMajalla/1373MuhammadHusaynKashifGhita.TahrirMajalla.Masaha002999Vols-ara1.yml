90#VERS#COMMENT##: The electronic edition downloaded from http://masaha.org
    is likely an earlier edition of the collated version (3rd printing)
    and is the same text.
    Qāʿidas introduced by مادّة: + number, some introduced by 'number -' (e.g.,
    -1).
    SPL created page divisions (w/o pagination).
    Only main titles annotated.
    Includes indices. Overall, excellent correspondence.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
