    3- PageV02P014-18 have pictures. 4- The leveling of the headers in the PDF’s
    table of contents is not correct. I tried to present a correct leveling as far
    as it can be inferred from the headers. However, anybody who will read the text
    carefully might decide to change the leveling of some headers.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
