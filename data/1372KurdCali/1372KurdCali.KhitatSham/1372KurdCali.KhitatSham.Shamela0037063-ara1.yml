90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The whole volume 5, PageV03P129-136, No. 193 (in
    PageV06P106), and No. 559 (in page PageV06P151) are missing. 2. The tag ### $ is
    used for the place entries like the names of schools, mosques... (A few of such
    entries are inside the lines, or are just descriptions of places without any
    name. To maintain the consistency of the numbers, I tagged them as well). 3. The
    numbers of entries are checked by Peter’s script.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
